# Network Analysis on Global Offshoring and Tax Avoidance Behaviour

## Introduction

This project used network analytics methodologies to construct and analyse the global offshoring network contained in the Offshore Leaks papers. The Offshore Leaks papers span over 80 years and contain relationships between more than 200 countries and territories worldwide. The key objectives of this project are: 
- (1) To discover global offshoring network structures and behaviours; 
- (2) To explore and test the networkâ€™s resilience; 
- (3) To identify the top countries and financial regions.

## Approach

- Extracting 6 network metrics to understand the network structure and behavior.
- Using community detection algorithms to identify closely connected groups of territories.
- Selecting the most suitable algorithms based on research questions, objectives, and factors like size and interpretability.
- Employing random and targeted deletion strategies to test network resilience and simulate effective disintegration.
- Tracking network metrics to assess network persistence during disruption. 

This methodology aims to provide insights into the network and enable effective network disruption strategies.

## Insights

The study provides several insights and recommendations for policymakers to reduce offshoring activities:

- Implement localized policies based on regional offshoring behaviors. Trust-based regions would benefit from region-wide preventive policies, while developed regions should collaborate with other regions to combat offshoring. 

- Focus on highly active territories to disrupt the network.  Cooperation from these countries is crucial for effectively combating global offshoring.

- Differentiate tax haven territories based on their characteristics. Capital-rich territories require political pressure, while offshoring bases can be targeted with sanctions and tax penalties.

- Emphasize cooperation and restrictions between countries rather than targeting individuals. Preventive policies should focus on limiting offshoring activities between regions. Node removal is more effective than edge removal in disrupting the network.

These recommendations aim to address offshoring practices through collaborative efforts and targeted measures, considering the specific behaviors and characteristics of different regions and territories involved in offshoring activities.
